## Code Clean and Refactor Rules
- The name of class, function or variable should be meaning.
- Code should follow Stepdown Rule. Reading Code from Top to Bottom
- Function only do one thing.
- Zero arguments for a function is very good. One argument is good. Two arguments are enough good. Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.
