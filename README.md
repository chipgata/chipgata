## Code Clean and Refactor Rules
- The name of class, function or variable should be meaning.
- Code should follow Stepdown Rule. Reading Code from Top to Bottom
- The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Function only do one thing.
- Zero arguments for a function is very good. One argument is good. Two arguments are enough good. Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification—and then shouldn’t be used anyway.
- Try/catch blocks are ugly in their own right. They confuse the structure of the code and mix error processing with normal processing. So try/cactch should do on main function, the function which is called can skip try/catch.
- `Don’t Repeat Yourself`
- Add new is better than change, but if need to update, update on one place is better than multiple places, if you are not trust your memory
